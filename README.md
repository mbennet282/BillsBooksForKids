# Bill's Books For Kids online store sample

An online store for a fictitious company called "Bill's Books for Kids" written in ASP classic.

Right now, there is a Microsoft Access database that stores the books (bbk.mdb), a search page (search.asp) a home page (default.asp), an add to cart logic (addtocart.asp), a shopping cart (shoppingcart.asp) and a books catalog (books.asp) that reads the database and displays the information, some simple styling (styles.css) and an mdquery.asp file that is used to manipulate the bbk.mdb file. The pretend payment options wil be done next. Additionally, I might add some more tables in bbk.mdb and store foreign key constraints.
