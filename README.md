# Bill's Books For Kids online store sample

An online store for a fictitious company called "Bill's Books for Kids" written in ASP classic.

Right now, there is a Microsoft Access database that stores the books (bbk.mdb), a home page (default.asp), a books catalog (books.asp) that reads the database and displays the information, some simple styling (styles.css) and an mdquery.asp file that is used to manipulate the bbk.mdb file. The project is unfinished and still needs to be worked on including shopping cart, payments (not actual ones), authentication and an admin page for adding new books to the bbk.mdb file as well some small edits here and there.
